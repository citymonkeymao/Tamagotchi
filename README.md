# Install
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
# Play
Change directory to game, run ```python game.py```, you will enter an IPython interactive interface. The game starts here. Following introductions is ordered by the evolving history of the pet.
## Basic pet
The basic pet has only one metric, hunger. By feeding it, the hunger metric will increase. This pet will not die even if the hunger became negative.

* create a basic pet: in IPython interface, enter:

 ```pokemon = BasicPet()```
 
  a basic pet called pokemon is created.

* to start playing the game, type in: 

 ```start_play(pokemon)```


 By this time, a figure generated by Matplotlib will come to your screen, the big blue bar indicate the hunger metric, the lower the bar, the hungery your pet.

* feeding will increase the hunger value, go back to command line:

 ```pokemon.feed()```

Basic pet is the only type supported in 1st release which contains only 4 files. ```metric.py``` defines the update strategies of metrics which were used to represent status of pet such as hunger, happiness and health, and gives an interface to increase the value. ```pet.py``` is the class file for BasicPet. These two files were not modified later on, new types of pet and metric come to the game by adding new files. ```game.py``` is the program's entrance. ```thread_utils.py``` were renamed as ```decorators.py```, the @sync decorator defined in it makes a function thread safe as the main program often involves two threads, one thread read user input, another update and show the status.
This version is a minimal workable product.

## Mortal creature
Just like basic pet, mortal creature has only one metric and one action. However, if the hunger metric goes blow zero, this animal is going to die. Trying to feed or update a dead pet will incur PetDeadException.

* create and start play,

 ```mortal = MortalCreature()```
 <br>
 ```start_play(mortal)```
 <br>
 If no more command following, the pet will die when it's hunger goes to zero. 
* By feeding it, the creature could stay alive.

 ```mortal.feed()```

* Feeding the dead could result in an exception
 wait for few seconds until the pet die.............
 ```mortal.feed()```

2 files were added at this stage, ```death_metric.py``` defines the behavior of a metric that can cause death. ```mortal_creature.py``` defines a pet that will raise exception when dead.

## Koala
A koala typically sleeps 18 hours a day, during the sleep hours, it does not eat anything. Thus, a koala can only be feed from 00:00AM to 06:00AM

* create a koala and start play:

 ```k = Koala()```
 
  ```start_play(k)```
  
* try to feed koala in sleeping time:

 when the daytime bar is larger than 6 and the legend shows it's sleeping.....
 
 ```k.feed()```

 the hunger will not increase if you feed it at this time, but feeding in awake state will.
 
* When you put a koala to bed, it will sleep despite of the time, this operation is only allowed when the pet is awake.

  ```k.to_bed()```
  
* to make it awake again, manually take it out of bed is necessary. off_bed can be called when the animal is sleeping.

 ```k.off_bed()```

## multi-metric pet
Simply add two metrics: happiness and health. Happiness will increase if you play with it, health will increase when you clean it. If health goes 0, the pet dies.

* create and start play:

 ```m = MultiMetricPet()```
 <br>
 ```start_play(b)```
 
* clean and play:

 ```m.clean()```
 <br>
 ```m.play()```
 
 ## Aging pet
 Another factor of the Tamagotchi is that an animal has its own life cycle. An aging pet has two stages in its life, before its 20s, we call it young. 20 to 40 is called old. Finally, this creature will die on 40. The age increases every 2 seconds.

* create and play

```a = AgingPet()```
<br>
```start_play(a)```

* feed, clean, play, to bed and off bed

```a.feed()```
<br>
```a.clean()```
<br>
```a.play()```
<br>
```a.to_bed()```
<br>
```a.off_bed()```
<br>


# Known issues
* Not able to invoke start_play twice, a possible reason is that matplotlib is not thread safe. A walk through is to restart game each time. One way to solve this problem is use another UI library.
* The figure window pauses for few seconds after input a command. The reason is unknown.
